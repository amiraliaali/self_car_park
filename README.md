## Overview
This project implements a reinforcement learning approach using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train an autonomous agent (a free-moving car) to navigate a space with obstacles and reach a predefined goal spot without collisions. The agent learns through trial and error, improving its navigation strategy over time.

## Features
- Implemented using **PyTorch** for deep reinforcement learning.
- Uses a **custom-built environment** for training the car agent.
- **PPO-based Actor-Critic architecture** for policy optimization.
- **Model checkpointing** to save the best-performing model.
- **Dynamic learning rate scheduling** for better training efficiency.
- **Training performance visualization** through loss and return graphs.

## Environment Details
The environment consists of:
- A car that starts from a random location.
- Randomly placed obstacles at predefined locations.
- A randomly chosen parking spot (goal) that the car needs to reach without collisions.
- Discrete action space defining possible movements.
- Reward function guiding the agent towards the goal.

```

## Running the Training
Using vscode, simply run the task ```Car Park UI```.

## Model Architecture
The PPO model consists of:
- **Actor Network**: Predicts action probabilities.
- **Critic Network**: Estimates state values for advantage calculation.
- **Layer Normalization & ReLU activations** to improve training stability.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different reward shaping strategies.
- Extend the environment with dynamic obstacles.
- Compare PPO with other RL algorithms like DQN or SAC.
